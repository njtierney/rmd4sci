# About this {-}

This is a book on rmarkdown, aimed for scientists. It was initially developed as a 3 hour workshop, but is now developed into a resource that will grow and change over time as a **living book**.

This book aims to teach the following:

- Getting started with your own R Markdown document
- Improve workflow:
  - With rstudio projects
  - Using keyboard shortcuts
- Export your R Markdown document to PDF, HTML, and Microsoft Word
- Better manage figures and tables
    - Reference figures and tables in text so that they dynamically update
    - Create captions for figures and tables
    - Change the size and type of figures
    - Save the figures to disk when creating an rmarkdown document
- Work with equations
    - inline and display
    - caption equations
    - reference equations
- Manage bibliographies
  - Cite articles in text
  - generate bibliographies
  - Change bibliography styles
- Debug and handle common errors with rmarkdown
- Next steps in working with rmarkdown - how to extend yourself to other rmarkdown formats
    
## Why write this as a book?

There are many great books on rmarkdown and it's various features, such as ["Rmarkdown: The definitive guide"](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/), ["bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown"](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/), and ["Dynamic Documents with R and knitr, Second edition"](https://www.crcpress.com/Dynamic-Documents-with-R-and-knitr/Xie/p/book/9781498716963), and Yihui Xie's thesis, ["Dynamic Graphics and Reporting for Statistics"](https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/etd/13518/).

> So why write a book?

Good question. The answer is that writing this as a book provides a way for me to structure the content in the form of a workshop, in a way suitable for learning in a few hours.
